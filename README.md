The program runs on data structures. The original idea was to have a game about a dwarf escaping from a tavern. He staggers here and there, gets in fights, loses hp, gains gold [game currency], picks up items, is repositioned by certain enemies [barman, bouncer, wizard], can run into mimics masquerading as furniture, and so on. The foundations of the game are definitely there. But it is a lot of work! I may return to it, but it is the biggest solo project I have worked on to date so I am quite happy.
